Ans11. Deeplearning:- Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.


Ans12. Reinforcement learning:-  Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Reinforcement Learning is like many topics with names ending in -ing such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning in AI techniques etc. Some names like planning and mountaineering, in that it is simultaneously a problem, a class of solution methods that work well on the class of problems, and the field that studies these problems and their solution methods.”

    1.	Machine Learning is a superset of Deep Learning.	              Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
    2.The data represented in Machine Learning is quite different as          The data representation is used in Deep Learning is quite different as it uses neural 
      compared to Deep Learning as it uses structured data                    networks(ANN).

    3.Machine Learning is an evolution of AI.                                 Deep Learning is an evolution to Machine Learning. Basically it is how deep is the                                                                                      machine learning.

    4-	Machine learning consists of thousands of data points.                Big Data: Millions of data points.

    5.	Outputs: Numerical Value, like classification of score.              Anything from numerical values to free-form elements, such as free text and sound.

       variables in data sets.


Ans14. In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.A neural network is an interconnected system of perceptrons, so it is safe to say perceptrons are the foundation of any neural network. Perceptrons can be viewed as building blocks in a single layer in a neural network.
A neural network, which is made up of perceptrons, can be perceived as a complex logical statement (neural network) made up of very simple logical statements 
(perceptrons); of “AND” and “OR” statements. A statement can only be true or false, but never both at the same time. The goal of a perceptron is to determine from 
the input whether the feature it is recognizing is true, in other words whether the output is going to be a 0 or 1. A complex statement is still a statement, and its
output can only be either a 0 or 1.

1- AI stands for Artificial intelligence, where intelligence is defined acquisition of    ML stands for Machine Learning which is defined as the acquisition of                                                                                           knowledge or skill.
   knowledge intelligence is defined as a ability to acquire and apply knowledge.

2- The aim is to increase chance of success and not accuracy.                             The aim is to increase accuracy, but it does not care about success.

3- It work as a computer program that does smart work.                                    It is a simple concept machine takes data and learn from data.

4- The goal is to simulate natural intelligence to solve complex problem.                 The goal is to learn from data on certain task to maximize the performance of                                                                                           machine on this task.

5- AI is decision making.                                                                 ML allows system to learn new things from data.

6- AI leads to intelligence or wisdom.                                                    ML leads to knowledg
