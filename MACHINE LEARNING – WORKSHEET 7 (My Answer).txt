Ans1. (A) SVMs use hyperplanes as decision boundary for classification. and 
      (B) SVMs uses kernel functions to avoid computational load of converting the whole dataset in to higher dimensional space where the data is linearly separable.

Ans2. (B)  Blue

Ans3. (B) Higher the value of gamma of RBF the more flexible the classifier curve becomes in the original dimensions. and 
      (C)  A very high value of gamma may lead to overfitting.

Ans4. (B) A Soft Margin Linear classifier

Ans5. (B) The margin width will Increase

Ans6. (A) Figure A

Ans7. (C) D3>D2>D1

Ans8. (C) Gamma2 > Gamma 1 

Ans9. (B) The model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for modelling

Ans10. (A) A large number of misclassification would happen
